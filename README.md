# ebird_phylotree: Show your eBird Species on a Global Bird Phylogeny

This project lets you create your own **bird phylogenetic tree** using an exported **eBird species checklist**, matched to the **OpenTree of Life**, and visualized in **R using ggtree**.

If you're an eBirder and want to see how your observed species are distributed on the bird tree of life, this tool makes it easy and automatic.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo or download files.
2. Place your `MyEBirdData.csv` (downloaded from eBird) into this folder.
3. Run `ebird_phylotree_simpleversion.R`. It will automatically install required packages if not already installed.
4. A circular tree will be plotted, showing only your observed species in (Yale) blue.
