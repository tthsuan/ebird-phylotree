# ebird_phylotree: Highlight eBird Species on a Global Bird Phylogeny

This R script reads your personal eBird checklist (CSV), matches observed species to the OpenTree of Life, and highlights them on a circular bird phylogeny.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo or download files.
2. Place your `MyEBirdData.csv` (downloaded from eBird) into this folder.
3. Run `ebird_phylotree_simpleversion.R`. It will automatically install required packages if not already installed.
